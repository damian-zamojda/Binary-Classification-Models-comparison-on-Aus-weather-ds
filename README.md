# Binary-Classification-Models-comparison-on-Aus-weather-ds


## Introduction

In this project we compare several binary classification models using dataset consisting binary target variable.

Target of the models is to predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.

We used GBM and XGBoost models to do the predictions, ROC curve to find the best threshold and 
Area Under Curve (AUC), Accuracy, F1 Score, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision and Recall to evaluate the models. 


## About the dataset
The dataset used in this project contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia. 
It was shared by Joe Young on the Kaggle platform and is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)
